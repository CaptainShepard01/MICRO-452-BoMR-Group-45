    "This project leverages the Thymio robot to explore and integrate key concepts introduced in the Introduction to Mobile Robotics course. We hereby focus on implementing and demonstrating core components: computer vision, global navigation, motion control, local navigation, and filtering. The mission of the robot is to navigate itself from the designated start position to the specified goal position, successfully avoiding fixed obstacles as well as dynamically placed one. Achieving this requires precise motion control, robust obstable detection, and efficient filtering technique. Such practical application of the five above-mentioned elements would reflect our team's comprehensive understanding of mobile robotics principles."

    "Computer vision is the first step in our project, as it is the basic input. To steer the robot in an environment, we need to know the robot's position in that environment, what obstacles are present, where to go, and whether data acquisition is proceeding correctly. This is the purpose of the `ComputerVision` class we have implemented. All this data will then be used to predict the optimal path from the starting position to the goal, avoiding obstacles, and to provide an initial estimate of the position to be given to the Kalmann filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We distinguish several parts in this explanation: the general setup, including the camera, the creation of the map, and the creation of markers to detect the robot and the goal. We then talk about detecting obstacles in the map, which the robot must avoid. Finally, the detection of the robot and the goal is a crucial part, which will be done using ArUco markers. \n",
    "\n",
    "## <a id='toc4_2_'></a>[I.2 Setup : camera, map, and markers](#toc0_)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to create is the environment in which our robot will evolve. This environment is made up of delimited obstacles in a free zone for the robot. After several computer vision tests, we decided that our obstacles would be represented by red shapes on a white background. This choice is explained in greater detail in the following section on obstacle detection. Once our map has been created, we need to find a way of finding the robot in the image. To do this, we chose to use the ArUco markers provided by the OpenCV library in Python. These markers are QR-code-like representations with unique identifiers that can be easily detected in space. By defining a marker for the robot, and a marker for the goal, we can extract their respective positions to define the robot's shortest path to the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "ArUco markers are defined by two things: a dictionary and an identifier. In our case, we use the dictionary `DICT_6X6_250` and IDs 4 and 8 for the robot and goal respectively. A marker is generated as follows, where `marker_id` is the defined ID of the marker, and `marker_size` is the size of the marker in pixels:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dictionary   = cv2.aruco.getPredefinedDictionary(cv2.aruco.DICT_6X6_250)\n",
    "marker_image = cv2.aruco.generateImageMarker(dictionary, marker_id, marker_size)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To have enough markers to test the robustness of our code, we created and printed a grid of 9 markers, for IDs from 0 to 8.\n",

    "When using a camera, two parameters need to be determined: the camera matrix $C$ and the distortion coefficients $D$. Matrix $C$ contains the camera's intrinsic parameters: focal lengths and optical center, along the $x$ and $y$ axes. These parameters are  denoted by: $f_x$, $f_y$ (focal lengths) and $c_x$, $c_y$ (optical center), which gives us: $$C = \\begin{pmatrix} f_x & 0 & c_x \\\\ 0 & f_y & c_y \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The distorsion matrix $D$ is defined as $D = \\begin{pmatrix} k_1 & k_2 & p_1 & p_2 & k_3 \\end{pmatrix}$ where the parameters are defined in [Camera Calibration](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thw two matrices $C$ and $D$ are found using calibration. The code used for our calibration comes from the *GeeksForGeeks* website, on the [Camera Calibration with Python - OpenCV](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/camera-calibration-with-python-opencv/) page. The calibration is usually performed using a reference image such as a checkerboard. We used a checkerboard with 9 by 7 inner corners, and with $20$mm square length. By taking several photos from different angles and heights of the checkerboard, we can correct the distorted image. An image of the calibration process is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"report-images/checkerboard_calibration.png\" alt=\"checkerboard_calibration.\" width=\"750\" class=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, we have decided to set the origin at the top left corner of the image. To achieve this, the optical centers $c_x$ and $c_y$ were set to $0$. In addition, distortion coefficients were considered negligible when comparing data with and without calibration. Once these matrices are known, the camera is initialized and can be used to detect obstacles and ArUco markers.\n",

This returns an image with values of $255$ (white) for pixels detected as red, and $0$ (black) everywhere else.

The second and third arguments in `cv2.Canny` represent the lower and upper thresholds for the hysteresis step. Pixels with gradient intensities above the upper threshold are classified as edges, while those below the lower threshold are ignored. Pixels with intensities between the thresholds are included as edges only if they are connected to a strong edge. The limit values found were obtained after several tests to extract edges on different shades of red, and appear to be optimal for our application.\n",

Our function `get_corners_and_shape_edges(edges)` use a polygonal approximation of the shapes found. This approximation allows each obstacle to be represented as a polygon, and therefore to have the corners of these polygons. To study each contour separately, we use `cv2.findContours`. \n",

Finally, the quaternion is converted to Euler angles using the function `euler_from_quaternion`. This function calculates roll (rotation around the $x$-axis), pitch (rotation around the $y$-axis), and yaw (rotation around the $z$-axis). Among these, the yaw angle is extracted because it represents the rotation of the marker in the $x$-$y$ plane, which corresponds to the marker's orientation relative to the camera."

The absolute position of the robot can be obtained directly from the camera and global path planning techniques, but the robot may have low precision and update rate, causing drifts when the velocity or acceleration is integrated. We can address this challenge by implementing Kalman filter as it provides a sound framework to use all available measurements in an optimal way. It relies on a model for the system structure and the effect of disturbances both on the state and on the measurements.\n",
